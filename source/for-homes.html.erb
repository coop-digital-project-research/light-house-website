      <h2>Save money on your electric</h2>

      <p>LED light bulbs use a 10th of the energy of old fashioned ones. Switching to LED light bulbs could save you over £100 a year!</p>

      <h2>LED light bulbs are expensive</h2>

      <p>LED lights last a lot longer but they’re expensive to buy, especially for a whole house. It’s not right that only those with £100s of spare cash get to buy them, saving themselves £100s a year.</p>

      <h2>Renting LED light bulbs makes more sense</h2>

      <p>For £1 a week, Light House can give you 20 LED light bulbs. After 3 years, you’ll then own the bulbs.</p>

        <h3>We provide top quality, modern LED light bulbs</h3>

        <p>We use top brand LED lights that provide instant-on, high quality light.</p>

        <p>Many people find LED lights provide a higher quality of light than old fashioned, incandescent or fluorescent lights. And LED technology doesn’t suffer from slow warm up times. Finally, LEDs don’t run as hot as older bulbs so are generally safer to use.</p>

        <h3>We keep it simple with 20 LED light bulbs</h3>
        <p>Most houses get the maximum benefit by replacing the most used 20 light bulbs with LED lights.</p>

        <p>To simplify administration and make it possible, we always offer 20 light bulbs at a fixed £1 per week charge.</p>

        <h3>Community finance can help</h3>
        <p>At £1 a week for three years, it will cost you £156 to purchase LED light bulbs through Light House.</p>

        <p>We estimate that a household could buy equivalent bulbs on the high street for around £100 - £120.</p>

        <p>If you have the spare cash and are confident in choosing the right light bulbs, it may be better to purchase them outright and manage your own warranties.</p>

        <p>For households that can’t easily find £120 or who are unsure about what brightness, colour and fittings they require, we believe Light House provides a low cost, convenient option.</p>

        <p>Because Light House is a local social enterprise, there are no banks involved. The money is lent by people in the community and the money stays where it belongs: in the community.</p>
