      <p>Light House is a collaboration between the Sheffield Renewables and the Co-operative Group.</p>

      <p>Sheffield Renewables is a community-owned social enterprise that develops and runs solar and hydroelectric generators in Sheffield.</p>

    <div class="col-9 proposition">
      <h2>LED lighting typically saves households £2-3 a&nbsp;week</h2>

      <p>By switching to the latest energy efficient light bulbs, households can save over £100 a year. And even though they last many times longer than old fashioned bulbs, many households just don’t have the spare cash to buy LED light bulbs.</p>

      <h2>Households pay £1 a week for three&nbsp;years</h2>

      <p>Supported by the Co-op, Sheffield Renewables are raising capital through community shares to fund LED light bulb retrofitting.</p>

      <p>To get involved, households pay just £1 per week for 3 years, after which they own the bulbs. With an expected lifetime of up to 15 years, the savings can have a huge impact on a household in fuel poverty.</p>

      <h2>Households join a wider&nbsp;community</h2>

      <p>By joining the scheme, households also become members of Green Quarter Community Energy Co-operative, allowing them to have their say on funding future community projects.</p>

      <p>Participation in community groups can also help reduce loneliness and improve engagement in other community projects.</p>

      <h2>Reduce the carbon impact of your housing stock</h2>

      <p>Retrofitting LED lighting can save around a tonne of carbon per household per year.</p>

      <p>For a housing association with 20,000 houses that’s roughly equivalent to taking 8,000 cars off the road each&nbsp;year.</p>
